I was looking for a podcast in German to listen to and I have been having
the idea of finding a good software development podcast for a while now. 
Looking into this I found [Tech Tiefen](https://www.techtiefen.de/). 
I tried the episode about Web Assembly and not knowing anything about the topic 
I enjoyed it, learn from it and on top the German they use is quite clear! 
I can definitely recommend it.
