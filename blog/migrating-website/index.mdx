Starting to write a bit of content everyday brought to the forefront a very obvious problem of
plain html/css sites: How do you store and diplay content cleanly and efficiently? I'd like 
each post to be an independent file whose content gets injected in the desired page.
This needs some JS and probably quiet some fine tuning. I decided that it was the time to
start using a Static Site Generator and fully jump into the 
[JamStack train](https://jamstack.org/). Given that I want to learn React and Node 
I opted to use [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com/) as my site generator. Originally 
I thought about using a template, but ended up going for following the tutorial
and that was definitely the right choice. I can understand the foundations and then 
move to more advance design without feeling lost!
