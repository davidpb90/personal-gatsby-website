At work we're using GTM and GA4 to track anonymised user behaviour in our website. 
I noticed that page views were double firing in the GA4 debugger. I found most upvoted 
answer in [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75745048/all-events-duplicated-in-google-analytics-4-debugger) to be extremely helpful.
Using the Network section of Chrome's DevTools I managed to find out that
the relevant tags where double firing in a way: firing once for the whole website 
and another time for an embedded iframe.
