I've been figuring out how to include interactive maps in my personal 
website. D3 and other options where you have to build the map from scratch, 
basically as polygons, seems like too much overhead, 
specially when the specific use cases are not yet well defined. 
Looking for something that could bring me decent results quickly while 
retaining some degree of control I though about 
[Open Street Maps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). 
However, it does not seem to support personal maps. Looking a bit more, 
I found [Umap](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/), which allows 
you to build your own customise map on top of Open Street Maps. 
I managed to quickly draw some maps showing some of the trips 
I've made and to embed this interactive map in my 
[website](travels.html) by simply pasting a code snippet. 
However, today I found out about [Leaflet](https://www.leafletjs.com/), 
which would allow me to programatically build custom maps on top of 
Open Street Maps or other available online mapping tools. 
I want to try this out in the feature, given that it will give me 
more options for further customisation and interactivity.
