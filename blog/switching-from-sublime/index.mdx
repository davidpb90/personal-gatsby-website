In order to test GitHub Copilot I had to install Visual Studio Code. However, 
at least for the time being, I don't want to learn a whole new set of key bindings. 
Fortunately I found a 
[VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings) 
that sets up as many of the Sublime keybindings as possible. 
After installing the extension I simply had to restart VS Code and voil√†, 
I could use it in exactly the same way I was using Sublime before. 
I don't yet know if I'm going to switch completely, 
but this time I'm going to give VS Code a fair chance.
